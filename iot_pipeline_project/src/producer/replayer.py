# This is a replayer script.
# It reads the already-saved raw_sensor_data.jsonl file and replays everything back into Kafka.
# Normal producer -> generates NEW fake data -> saves to JSONL -> sends to Kafka
# Replayer -> reads EXISTING JSONL -> sends to Kafka (no new data generated)

# Used for the small delay between messages to avoid overwhelming local Kafka.
